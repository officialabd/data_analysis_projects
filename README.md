# Udacity Data Analysis Program - Projects

## DESCRIPTION

Welcome to my repository for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program! This program provided a comprehensive introduction to data analysis using Python, with a focus on libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and pandas. Throughout the course, I completed three main projects, each designed to enhance my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and analysis.

### Projects:

1. **Investigate a Dataset**:

   - Applied the data analysis process of questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data using Python libraries like NumPy and pandas.
2. **Real World Data Wrangling with Python**:

   - Learned advanced data wrangling techniques, including gathering, assessing, and cleaning data to transform raw and messy data into a clean format for analysis.
3. **Communicate Data Findings**:

   - Applied data visualization principles using Matplotlib and Seaborn to tell compelling stories with data through analysis and visualizations.
